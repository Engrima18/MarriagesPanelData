# MarriagesPanelData

Exploring socio-economic factors impacting marriages and divorces: a Panel Data Analysis. Final project for the course in Data-Driven Economics, master's degree in Data Science @ Sapienza University of Rome (a.y. 2023/24).

## Brief Description

- **What**: we study the causal relationships between socioeconomic factors such as net median income and employment rate, and levels of new marriages and divorces in different European nations. In particular, we analyze how indices of welfare distinctly by sex are influencing social relationships.
- **Where**: we focus the analysis across 25 European countries
- **When**: we restricted the study over 13 years (2009-2022)
- **Why**: the findings from this analysis can have significant policy implications for governments and policymakers. Understanding the factors influencing marriage and divorce rates can inform the design of targeted interventions aimed at promoting stable family structures and social well-being.

We derived our dataset `data.csv` from several joint datasets provided by [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat) and [United Nations data](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/content/datasets). We collected independent variables such as economic indicators and welfare indicators, sometimes distinguishable by gender, referring to a particular country in a particular year (see the slides in `presentation.pdf` for further information).
